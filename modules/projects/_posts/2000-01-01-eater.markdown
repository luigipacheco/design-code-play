# Project 01 Eater

## Overview
In our first project will code a game that lets us move arround a charater to "eat" food in the screen.

First lets define some key aspects of our project by asking the following questions:

- How do I put something in the screen?
- How do I move it arround?
- How do I make something disappear when my charater "touches" it?
- How do I count how much food the character has ate?

## Activities

- Draw your own character

## Take your project to the next level

Think about an extra added value for your game:
  - make your eater "Grow" when it eats something.
  - add different "food" types.
  - Make "poison" items.
  - Add an extra eater to play with a friend?
  - Animate your sprites
