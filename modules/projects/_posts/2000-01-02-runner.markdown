# Project 02 Runner!

## Overview
In our second project will code a game that lets us run and jump while avoiding obstacles that randomly spawn.

First lets define some key aspects of our project by asking the following questions:

- How do I make my character jump?
- How do I make my character move forward?
- How do I keep track of the score?
- How do I reset the game?

## Activities

- Draw your own character
- Draw your own "obstacle"
- Draw your own "floor"
- Add sounds for jumping and colliding with an obstacle. 



## Reflect & share

 - What did I discovered by doing this project?
 - What did I wish I knew before this project?
 - What was the most difficult part and how I overcame it?
 - What do I love from this project?
 - What do I want to improve in this project?

Remember to "publish" your project and share it with us in Discord.

## Take your project to the next level

Think about an extra added value for your game:
  - make your runner "Jump" higher when you press a key twice.
  - add different "obstacle" types.
  - Collect items.
  - Add an extra runner to play with a friend
  - Animate your sprites
