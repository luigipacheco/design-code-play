## Overview
Our second project will be do design sound machine that makes noise, tones, music, etc. By touching things (capacitance).

First lets frame some main ideas for our project

- What type of machine I want to make? (check inspiration projects)
- What is [capacitance](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/circuits-topic/circuits-with-capacitors/v/capacitors-and-capacitance), and what objects or materials can I use for this?
- What shape or instrument do I want to make?
- What materials do I need to make my sound machine?
- What makes my sound machine special or different?

## Activities

- Draw a sketch for your Sound Machine
- Draw a flow diagram for your Sound Machine's functionality
- Program the circuit playground to react make sounds according to the capacitive inputs.
- Make a prototype for your Sound Machine, test different materials, put all the parts together.
- Test and observe
- Make changes in your code or/and your prototype
- Repeat the last two steps as needed.
- Try to play a song with your new Instrument.

## Reflect and share

 - What did I discovered by doing this project?
 - What did I wish I new before this project?
 - What was the most difficult part and how I overcame it?
 - What do I love from this project?
 - What do I want to improve in this project.

 Take some pictures of your project and share it on a presentation or video, try to use as little text as possible and tell the story of how you got where you are with your project.

## Take your project to the next level

Think about an extra added value for your sound machine:
  - Can you drive sounds on your computer with your Adafruit Circuit Playground?
  - What about adding speakers?
  - What other sensors can I use to drive sound?
  - Develop a music instrument for someone with a disability.

## Further Learning

- [Make your own song](https://learn.adafruit.com/make-it-sound/overview) on your Circuit Playground.
