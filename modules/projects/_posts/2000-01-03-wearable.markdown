## Overview
Our third project will be do designs something that you can wear. It can be for a costume, cosplay or a gadget.

First lets frame some main ideas for our project

- What type wearable you want to create?
- What is it for?
- What information do we want to output from our wearable?
- What materials do I need to make my wearable?


## Inspiration

- [Chatty mask](https://learn.adafruit.com/chatty-light-up-cpx-mask)
## Activities

- Draw a sketch for your wearable
- Draw a flow diagram for your wearable functionality
- Program the circuit playground to your projects inputs and outputs
- Make a prototype for your wearable, test different materials, put all the parts together.
- Test and observe
- Make changes in your code or/and your prototype
- Repeat the last two steps as needed.
- Try to play a song with your new Instrument.

## Reflect and share

 - What did I discovered by doing this project?
 - What did I wish I new before this project?
 - What was the most difficult part and how I overcame it?
 - What do I love from this project?
 - What do I want to improve in this project.

 Take some pictures of your project and share it on a presentation or video, try to use as little text as possible and tell the story of how you got where you are with your project.

## Take your project to the next level

Think about an extra added value for your wearable:
  - What can you sense with your circuit playground that you cannot sense with your own senses?
  - Can you control a computer from your circuit playground sensors?
  - Think about making a computer human interface device.
