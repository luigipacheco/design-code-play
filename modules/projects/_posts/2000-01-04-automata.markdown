## Overview
Our fourth project will be do design something that moves.

First lets frame some main ideas for our project

- Your project should use at least one servomotor
- Your project can act directly on an object or it could drive some gears/pulleys
- Does your project moves as a whole (eg. car), or is it a mechanism (eg. clock)
- Determine the purpose of your project.
    - Does it point at something?
    - Does it move/tap/touch something?
    - Does it open/close something?
    - Can you play with it?

## Activities
- Draw a sketch for your project
- Draw a flow diagram for your projects functionality
- Program the circuit playground to your projects inputs and outputs
- Make a prototype for your project, test different materials, put all the parts together.
- Test and observe
- Make changes in your code or/and your prototype
- Repeat the last two steps as needed.


## Reflect and share

 - What did I discovered by doing this project?
 - What did I wish I new before this project?
 - What was the most difficult part and how I overcame it?
 - What do I love from this project?
 - What do I want to improve in this project.

 Take some pictures of your project and share it on a presentation or video, try to use as little text as possible and tell the story of how you got where you are with your project.
